<p>I have managed to get some PCB&rsquo;s designed based on my requirements.
Here is some 3D models of the first few boards I am getting made.</p>
<h1 id="backplane-pcb">Backplane PCB</h1>
<p>This board is essentially the main component all other boards will plug into.</p>
<h3 id="some-features-i-tried-to-nail-on-this-one">Some features I tried to nail on this one:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Allowed for up to 4 boards to be plugged in.</li>
<li>Each slot is addressable.</li>
<li>Provide connectors for 24V, 3V3 and 5V to be connected directly into the backplane (This could be replaced by a plug in board).</li>
</ol>
<p>By convention the CPU will be plugged into slot 1 and the PSU will be plugged into slot 4 though
this is just by convention and allowed space the backplane board have none of these restrictions
built in.</p>

<h1 id="cpu-pcb-rpi-and-stm32">CPU PCB (RPI and STM32)</h1>
<p>This is a board specifically designed for Raspberry Pi and STM32 based &ldquo;Blue Pill&rdquo; to interface with
the backplane. I however imagine there will be a CPU board designed for each SBC/Microcontroller that
needs to be interfaced with the backplane.</p>
<p>Some features I tried to nail on this one:</p>
<ol>
<li>Allow the controller to read what it is. This is done via an EEPROM chip.</li>
<li>Expose all the low level peripheral(SPI, Serial, PWM etc) to the rest of the backplane.</li>
</ol>
<p>By convention the CPU will be plugged into slot 1 and as explained above the backplane has no restriction that
forces this other than physical space.</p>
