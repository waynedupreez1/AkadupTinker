      <description>Description After killing my backplane idea I decided to try my hand at a distributed IO type system.
STM32F0 ADIO PCB I decided to use a stm32F030 mcu on this for 2 reasons: 1. its cheap about 1USD 2. rust is fully supported.
There is also a few selectable options set with solder bridges, I will talk about these options all through the post.
Digital: I allowed for 8 selectable inputs or outputs.</description>

      <description>Description Killing of the Industrial backplane and the reasons why.
Reasons The main reason for killing this project is because of economics, let me explain.
The idea with this system was to create a generic backplane, then create a cpu module for every controller board that we want to interface with the backplane. These cpu modules could technically be anything stm32 blue pill&amp;rsquo;s or raspberry pi&amp;rsquo;s or any cheap controller. The typical size of the cpu module would be about 50mm x 50mm which would cost 15USD for a 4 layer board.</description>

      <description>Description I have managed to get some PCB&amp;rsquo;s designed based on my requirements. Here is some 3D models of the first few boards I am getting made.
Backplane PCB This board is essentially the main component all other boards will plug into.
Some features I tried to nail on this one:  Allowed for up to 4 boards to be plugged in. Each slot is addressable. Provide connectors for 24V, 3V3 and 5V to be connected directly into the backplane (This could be replaced by a plug in board).</description>
