      <description>Description I have managed to get some PCB&amp;rsquo;s designed based on my requirements. Here is some 3D models of the first few boards I am getting made.
Backplane PCB This board is essentially the main component all other boards will plug into.
Some features I tried to nail on this one:  Allowed for up to 4 boards to be plugged in. Each slot is addressable. Provide connectors for 24V, 3V3 and 5V to be connected directly into the backplane (This could be replaced by a plug in board).</description>
