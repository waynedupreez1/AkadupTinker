      <description>Description As mentioned in STM32F0xx DigitalIO AnalogIn PCB one of the main reasons for me to take on this project is to learn some more rust lang. If rust is useful in an embedded setting I definitely will not subject myself to C again anytime soon, just kidding I like you C&amp;hellip;.nah not really.
Setup Hardware  Target =&amp;gt; STM32F030  This seemed like a pretty reasonable Cortex M0 chip the variation I use sports around 35 useful pins, 64K ROM and 8K RAM.</description>

      <description>Description So after geting some PCB&amp;rsquo;s made I decided to try my hand at writing drivers for the 34C04 EEPROM I2C chips that I use to identify each PCB plugged into the backplane board.
I decided to write this in rust as my C language foo is not so great, also rust is cool and I want to try it out for embedded work as I already use it for pc code development.</description>
