      <description>Description As mentioned in STM32F0xx DigitalIO AnalogIn PCB one of the main reasons for me to take on this project is to learn some more rust lang. If rust is useful in an embedded setting I definitely will not subject myself to C again anytime soon, just kidding I like you C&amp;hellip;.nah not really.
Setup Hardware  Target =&amp;gt; STM32F030  This seemed like a pretty reasonable Cortex M0 chip the variation I use sports around 35 useful pins, 64K ROM and 8K RAM.</description>

      <description>Description After killing my backplane idea I decided to try my hand at a distributed IO type system.
STM32F0 ADIO PCB I decided to use a stm32F030 mcu on this for 2 reasons: 1. its cheap about 1USD 2. rust is fully supported.
There is also a few selectable options set with solder bridges, I will talk about these options all through the post.
Digital: I allowed for 8 selectable inputs or outputs.</description>
